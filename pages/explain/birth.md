>It is an absolutely beautiful day and fangg and satoshi are taking a walk in their neighborhood. As they pass the cryptographic gardens, fangg takens an apple from his wallet and gives it to satoshi

satoshi: thanks i was hungry
fangg: you're welcome.

fangg: by the way, ive been having a lot of trouble managing my apple deliveries lately.

satoshi: whats the problem?

fangg: well, i always forget who i have given apples to. at the end of every day someone always comes to my door asking why they didn't get their apple.

satoshi: it sounds like you are having some memory slips. maybe you are giving some people more than one apple. I recomend going to the doctor, but while you are waiting for an appointment, try this. each time you give someone an apple, write down their name and the date.

fangg: great idea! i can compare my list of people to my list of apple deliveries and figure out who still needs an apple.

satoshi: exactly! though that sounds like a lot of work. i'm afraid you may not have time to deliver all your apples. especially if you spend as much time with each customer as you do with me.

fangg: darn! satoshi, i can't keep forgetting deliveries.

satoshi: dont worry just yet! i have another idea. my friend lisa from the next neighborhood over called me earlier today. she has started to keep track of apple deliveries for thier neighborbood's apple delivery man, mark.

fangg: great so i just have to find someone from our neighborhood to do that for me. Would you mind?

satoshi: unfortunately im much too busy. but there might be another option. what if every time you deliver an apple, you call lisa. she writes down your name the time and the person who you gave the apple. since she already has a list for mark, she can just add your deliveries there.

satoshi: in fact i think that the list is called a ledger. If my memory serves me well, it has been used for thousands of years to keep track of when and what people exchange. if you have any doubts whatsoever you can go ask lisa. she will look through the ledger and tell you if you have already made a delivery to a specific person today.

fangg: very clever, but i see a problem with your plan! what happens if lisa gets sick. even worse what if she decides to lie to me. can i really trust her with something this important?

satoshi: in my experience lisa is exceedingly trustworthy, but i see your point. what if you called many people each time you made a delivery and all of them kept a ledger? then if you suspect theres a problem with lisa's ledger, we can just ask everyone to send us a copy of their ledger and go with the majority.

fangg: that sounds great! but how will i get people to do all that work?

satoshi: good point...

fangg: ahha! ive got it! every time someone records a delivery, i'll give them an extra apple the next day.

satoshi: excellent idea! i'm excited to see how this plan works out. please let me know how it goes....now, you really should be getting to your next-

fangg: hold on. lets say i get 10 people from our neighborhood and 10 people from lisa's neighborhood to keep ledgers for me.

satoshi: fangg, where are you going with this?

fangg: if the people from our neighborhood get just one person from the other neighborhood to help them they would have the majority. they would be able to wreak all kinds of havoc! not to mention decieve me and get multiple apples a day!

satoshi: hmmm. i hadnt thought of that. it's not in my nature to be malicious, you know.

fangg: this was very interesting. thank you, but i think this scheme wont work after all. i'll have to resign myself to forgetting the ocassional customer.

satoshi: don't give up so easily! ahave you heard of the internet?

fangg: yes. what does that have to do with apples!?

satoshi: well, im thinking that instead of calling people every time you make a delivery, you send an internet message instead. this way you can have hundreds, or thousands, or millions

fangg: billions!

satoshi: of people with copies of the ledger. so many people that they couldnt possible collaborate to decieve you. i bet with some simple math we can make it almost impossible thay you are duped!

fangg: excellent! im convinced. lets set this up tomorrow. one last thing. what if mark or any of the other millions of apple delevery people decide they want in. whats to stop one of them from saying they delivered an apple twice? every ledger would be suspect!

satoshi: another excellent point. let me think for a moment.

fangg: do you mind if we walk towards rachel's house while you think? i really am very late in delivering her apple.

satoshi: not at all!

>While they walked to rachels house, Satoshi devoured his apple from the stem down.

fangg: have you found a solution? maybe it was in the apple core; to bad you ate the whole thing.

satoshi: very funny. i do think i have a solution. my proposal goes as follows. each time you or any other delivery person sends an internet message to the ledger keepers, they go through their copy of the ledger and make sure that the giver actually had an apple to give and the receiver is a real person. once they finish this, they send a message to the rest of the ledger keepers that the transaction is legitamite and they get their apple reward. once enough people confirm a transaction everyone will add that transaction to their copy of the ledger.

>fangg and satoshi turn around at the sound of someone suddendly clearing their throat.

throat clearer: uh excuse me. my name is nakamoto and, oh pardon if this is rude, but i happened to overhear your umm conversation about apples and uh ledgers on the internet. Im umm usually not one to showboat, but i am in fact a math whiz mmmm, and i think i can help. While you two were talking i found a math formula that involves a ledger and a new transaction. The amazing thing is that it only has a solution iff the transaction is valid!

fangg: wow thats great! satoshi, i think this might work! lets set this up this internet ledger tomorrow. nakamoto meet me and satoshi outside the cryptographic gardens at 8am. i really must be running off to give rachel her apple. good day to you both!

satoshi: thanks nakamoto. and by the way nice to meet you!

nakamoto: ummmm thanks. nice to uh meet you as well.
